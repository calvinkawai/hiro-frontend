## ðŸŽ¾ Quick start

1. **Set up env variables.**

    Our backend uses Parse (managed by Back4App).
    To connect to the backend, we need to setup a few environment variables.

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env.development
    ```

    Find the values in Back4App's system settings, and place them in the `.env.development` file.

2. **Start local development server.**

    ```shell
    npm run develop
    ```
